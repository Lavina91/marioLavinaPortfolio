# marioLavinaPortfolio

This project was to make a basic template for my personal responsive portfolio. Included in the portfolio is the following:
an about me with a bio section and links to my social medias, a portfolio section that is where future projects and homeworks will be stored and a contact page (which right now is not functional, but will be soon) to allow future employers to reach me via email.
